Here’s what’s new in our latest release

The block editor: you can now insert a File block into a post or page, which places a download button for files like documents. An update to the Gallery block also fixed an uploading issue when your editor was closed.

Site creation: when building pages on your site, the page layout options are now easier to see and select.

Post creation: want to quickly duplicate a post? You can now do so from your Posts List.

The Reader: do you use P2, a tool for team and group collaboration? You can read and follow P2 sites in a newly added stream.

Comments: want to subscribe to comment threads on sites you follow or are interested in? Tap the “Follow conversation” button in the Comments view.
